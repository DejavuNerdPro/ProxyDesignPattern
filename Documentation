The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. In other words, a proxy acts as an intermediary or a representative for an object and allows you to control access to the original object.

There are various scenarios where the Proxy Pattern is useful, such as:

Virtual Proxy: The virtual proxy is used to represent an expensive object. Instead of creating the object and allocating resources when it is not necessary, a virtual proxy can be used to create the object on demand.

Protection Proxy: The protection proxy controls access to a sensitive object by checking permissions before allowing the real object to be accessed.

Remote Proxy: A remote proxy represents an object that is in a different address space. This is often used in distributed systems where objects exist on different machines.

Cache Proxy: A cache proxy stores the results of expensive operations and returns the cached result when the same operations are requested again, instead of redoing the computation.

Logging Proxy: A logging proxy is used to keep a log of method calls on an object, which can be helpful for debugging or auditing purposes.

Here's a simple example in Java to illustrate the Proxy Pattern:

java
Copy code
// Subject interface
interface RealObject {
    void request();
}

// RealObject implementation
class RealObjectImpl implements RealObject {
    @Override
    public void request() {
        System.out.println("RealObject handling request");
    }
}

// Proxy class
class Proxy implements RealObject {
    private RealObjectImpl realObject;

    @Override
    public void request() {
        // Create the real object only when necessary
        if (realObject == null) {
            realObject = new RealObjectImpl();
        }
        // Additional logic can be added here before or after calling the real object
        System.out.println("Proxy handling request");
        realObject.request();
    }
}

// Client code
public class ProxyPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using the proxy to access the real object
        RealObject proxy = new Proxy();
        proxy.request();
    }
}
Save to grepper
In this example, the Proxy class acts as a proxy for the RealObjectImpl. It controls access to the real object and can perform additional actions before or after calling the real object's methods.
